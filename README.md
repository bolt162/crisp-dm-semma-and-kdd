# Data Science Methodology Deep Dive: CRISP-DM, SEMMA, and KDD

This repository contains the required artifacts, code, and detailed reports for the assignment demonstrating a principled, step-by-step, phase-by-phase approach to Data Science using three distinct methodologies: **CRISP-DM**, **SEMMA**, and **KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases)**.

-----

## Assignment Overview

The core objective of this assignment is to execute three separate, in-depth data science projects, each following one of the specified methodologies entirely, from business understanding/selection to final deployment/dissemination. A key requirement is the use of an advanced AI model (GPT-5/Claude) to act as a **domain-expert critic** to ensure the depth and completeness of every stage within each methodology.

### Key Requirements

1.  **Three Distinct Projects:** One for each methodology (CRISP-DM, SEMMA, KDD).
2.  **Three Datasets:** A unique dataset from Kaggle or Papers With Code for each project.
3.  **In-Depth Execution:** Full and detailed completion of all stages and sub-tasks for each methodology.
4.  **AI-Driven Critique:** Multiple revisions for each section, guided by a sophisticated, persona-driven AI critic (e.g., "World-renowned authority on CRISP-DM").
5.  **Comprehensive Deliverables:** Code, reports, external articles, and video walkthroughs for all three projects.

## 🔬 Methodologies and Projects

Three different datasets were selected to allow the projects to naturally align with the focus of each methodology.

| Methodology | Project Focus | Dataset Source | Directory |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) | End-to-End Business Solution (Full Cycle) | Kaggle/Papers With Code | `/crisp-dm_project` |
| **SEMMA** (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) | Focus on Data Manipulation and Modeling | Kaggle/Papers With Code | `/semma_project` |
| **KDD** (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) | Focus on Pattern Extraction and Knowledge Generation | Kaggle/Papers With Code | `/kdd_project` |

## 🤖 Technical and AI-Critique Approach

To ensure the depth and rigor required for this assignment, a robust technical and critique workflow was established.

### 1\. AI-Driven Iterative Refinement

For every phase (e.g., Data Understanding in CRISP-DM, Explore in SEMMA), the following iterative process was implemented:

1.  **Initial Draft:** Completion of the stage based on project requirements.
2.  **AI Critique Prompt:** The draft was fed into GPT-5/Claude with a prompt establishing a **high-authority persona** (e.g., "You are a world-renowned speaker and the primary author of award-winning books on the CRISP-DM methodology. Critically evaluate this Data Understanding phase for completeness, rigor, and adherence to best practices. Be ruthless.")
3.  **Revision:** The work was revised based on the critic's detailed feedback, ensuring all sub-tasks were met in depth. This cycle was repeated until the AI critic acknowledged the phase as complete and authoritative.

### 2\. Code Generation and Verification

  * **Advanced Tooling:** Assistance was taken from **MetaGPT** for initial project planning and structuring the phases.
  * **Code Generation:** GPT-5 was utilized for generating code snippets for complex tasks (e.g., feature engineering, model tuning).
  * **Manual Verification:** All generated code was **manually verified, validated, and optimized** to ensure correctness and integration into the final Colab notebooks, adhering to best-practice coding standards.

### 3\. Execution Environment

  * All detailed analysis and final code execution are presented in dedicated **Google Colab Notebooks** located within their respective project directories.
